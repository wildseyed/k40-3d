# k40-3d
Separate grey scale height maps into binary bitmaps for 3D engraving 

Needs Python and OpenCV

Eventually I weill be incorporating this code and all of the manual processing into K40 Whisperer. For now, you have to bring your resulting bitmaps into Inkscape, and save them as SVG files, since K40 Whisperer does not support loading bitmaps directly.
